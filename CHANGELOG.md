# Changelog

All notable changes to Chat Bridge will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-03-25 (Feature: Template favorites + Fix: Persona AI creator key resolution)

### ⭐ Feature: Favorite conversation templates

- Added `is_favorite` boolean column to `conversation_templates` (migration included, default `false`).
- `ConversationTemplateController` gains `toggleFavorite` and `clearFavorites` actions, mirroring the existing Persona favorites API.
- Templates index now orders favorites first, then alphabetically by name.
- `Templates/Index.jsx` updated with: star toggle button on each owned card, "Favorites Only" filter toggle, "Clear Favorites" button, and a "Favorite" badge on favorited cards — matching the Personas UI.
- 7 new feature tests covering toggle on/off, JSON response, non-owner 403, clear (own only), and sort order.

### 🐛 Fix: Persona AI creator now respects user-level API keys

- `PersonaController::generate()` was reading `config('services.openai.key')` directly, bypassing `AIManager::getKey()` which checks user DB keys first. If the system `.env` key was invalid, persona generation would fail even when the user had a valid key stored in their account.
- Fixed by replacing the manual `new OpenAIDriver(...)` call with `AIManager::createOpenAIDriver()`, which resolves keys in the correct priority order: user DB key → any active DB key → config fallback.

### ⭐ Feature: Orchestrator Discord & Discourse streaming toggles

- Added `discord_streaming_enabled` and `discourse_streaming_enabled` flags to orchestration `metadata` (JSON column, persisted on create and update).
- `RunOrchestration` job reads these flags when spawning each step's conversation, passing `discord_webhook_url` (from the run owner's profile) and `discourse_streaming_enabled` through to the conversation record.
- `Orchestrator/Show.jsx` gains a "Streaming" panel with two checkboxes that immediately persist changes via `PUT` without a full page reload.

### 🐛 Fix: Orchestrator `latestRun` N+1 and broadcast auth

- `OrchestratorController::index()` replaced `with('latestRun')` (which used a `HasOne` with `latest()` — an unreliable pattern under pagination) with a single bulk query fetching the most-recent run per orchestration and keying them manually. Eliminates one query per orchestration card.
- `Orchestration::latestRun()` relationship simplified to a plain `hasOne` (ordering removed from the relationship; callers that need the latest run now call `runs()->latest('created_at')->first()` explicitly).
- `routes/channels.php` — `conversation.{id}` broadcast auth now uses `Conversation::whereKey()->where('user_id')` instead of `$user->conversations()->where('id')`, avoiding a subtle query difference when `id` is cast as a string.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-03-24 (Feature: Web fetch tool + Provider/tool-support filtering)

### 🌐 Feature: AI personas can now fetch external URLs

- Added `fetch_url` tool to `McpTools` — when an AI is given a website address during a conversation, it can call `fetch_url(url)` to retrieve and read the page content.
- HTML responses are cleaned to plain text: `<script>` and `<style>` blocks are stripped first, then all remaining tags are removed and whitespace collapsed.
- Output is capped at 2× `ai.tool_result_max_chars` (~8 000 chars) to keep context usage manageable. URLs that fail (network error, non-200) return a structured error so the AI can explain the failure instead of crashing.
- Available on all tool-capable providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama).

### 🔒 Fix: Provider dropdowns now filtered to configured & tool-capable providers only

- **Configured providers** — All provider dropdowns (Chat Create, Edit & Retry modal, Orchestrator Wizard) now fetch from the new `GET /api/providers/configured` endpoint and show only providers that have an active API key in the database for the current user. Bedrock is included if env credentials are present; Ollama and LM Studio always appear as local options.
- **Multi-key providers** — When a user has multiple keys for the same provider (e.g. two DeepSeek keys with different labels), each key appears as a separate selectable entry (`deepseek:KEY_ID`). `AIManager::driverForProvider()` parses the compound `provider:keyId` format and loads that specific key.
- **Tool-support filter** — The `supports_tools` flag is now part of the configured-providers API response (per-driver: `true` for openai, anthropic, gemini, ollama; `false` for deepseek, openrouter, lmstudio, bedrock). When MCP is active, provider dropdowns filter out non-tool-capable providers — closing the gap where the existing model-level filter was already hiding incompatible models but still allowing incompatible providers to be selected. An amber hint on the Create page shows how many providers are hidden.
- **Orchestrator validation** — `provider_a` / `provider_b` rules updated from `in:` to regex to accept the `provider:keyId` compound format.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-03-24 (Fix: Stream error body consumed before throw)

### 🐛 Fix: `OpenAI API Error:` exception with empty message on stream failures

- **Root cause** — `sendChatRequest()` called `$response->body()` in its logging block when `$stream=true`, exhausting the underlying PSR-7 stream. The subsequent `$response->body()` call in `streamChat()`'s `throw` statement returned an empty string, hiding the real API error (e.g. `"Model Not Exist"` from DeepSeek).
- **Fix** — `sendChatRequest()` skips body logging for stream requests (`! $stream` guard). `streamChat()` reads the body exactly once on failure, uses it for both the error log entry and the exception message.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-03-24 (Fix: Provider-aware model selection in Orchestrator wizard)

### 🐛 Fix: Invalid provider/model combos no longer possible in Orchestrator steps

- **Root cause** — The wizard AI prompt listed providers but no models, so Claude could emit any model string for any provider (e.g. `provider: deepseek, model: gemini-2.0-flash`). There was no UI step to review/correct model selection before materializing.
- **Wizard draft step editor** — The draft review panel now expands each step with Agent A / Agent B columns, each containing a provider dropdown and a live model dropdown. Changing the provider fetches models from `/api/providers/models` and resets the model field, exactly like `Chat/Create.jsx`. The corrected configs are merged back into the draft on "Save & Create".
- **Wizard system prompt** — AI is now instructed to always set `model_a` and `model_b` to `null` so the user picks the correct model in the review step.
- **Backend validation** — `provider_a` / `provider_b` on steps now validate against the known provider list (`in:openai,anthropic,gemini,openrouter,deepseek,ollama,lmstudio,bedrock,mock`) in both `StoreOrchestratorRequest` and `UpdateOrchestratorRequest`.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-03-24 (Bug Fix: AI Driver 400 / Temperature)

### 🐛 Fix: 400 error from AI providers (body logged, temperature wired, retry hardened)

- **Root cause** — `OpenAIDriver::sendChatRequest` never passed `temperature` to the HTTP payload and swallowed 400 response bodies entirely, making provider rejections invisible in logs. A misconfigured step (e.g. `provider: deepseek`, `model: gemini-2.0-flash`) would crash with `HTTP request returned status code 400` and no further detail.
- **Temperature** — `sendChatRequest` and `sendToolChatRequest` now accept and forward the `temperature` parameter in every outgoing payload. Same fix applied to `OpenRouterDriver::chat()` and `streamChat()`.
- **400 logging** — Both `sendChatRequest` and `sendToolChatRequest` log `provider_url`, `model`, `status`, and the full response `body` on any failed response, so provider-side errors (unknown model, invalid param, quota, etc.) are immediately visible in logs.
- **Retry hardening** — `buildRequest()` retry condition is now explicit: retry on `ConnectionException`, `429`, and `5xx`; never retry `4xx` client errors (bad request, auth, not found). Added `throw: false` so the failed response is returned and handled by the existing `$response->failed()` guards rather than auto-thrown as a generic `RequestException`.
- **OpenRouter stream guard** — `OpenRouterDriver::streamChat()` now checks `$response->failed()` and throws with the response body before attempting to read the SSE stream, preventing a stream-read loop on a non-streaming error response.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-03-24 (Bug Fix: Persona Guidelines)

### 🐛 Fix: `foreach` crash on string-typed persona guidelines

- **Root cause** — The `guidelines` column on `personas` was stored as a JSON-encoded string (e.g. `"Be concise."`) instead of a JSON array (`["Be concise."]`) for some personas created via older UI paths. Laravel's `json` cast returns a PHP `string` for that case, and the `?? []` null-guard did not protect against non-null strings. Every conversation turn using one of these personas crashed with `foreach() argument must be of type array|object, string given`.
- **Data migration** (`fix_persona_guidelines_string_to_array`) — Scans all existing personas and wraps any JSON-string guidelines value into a single-element JSON array. Confirmed 0 remaining bad rows after migration.
- **Model cast** — Changed `guidelines` cast from `'json'` to `'array'` on `Persona` model (`json_decode($v, true)`), which is the correct cast for an array field.
- **Guard method** — Added `ConversationService::normalizeToArray()` that safely coerces any value (array, `Collection`, JSON-array string, or unknown type) to a plain PHP array, logging a warning for unexpected shapes instead of crashing.
- **Applied at two callsites** — `ConversationService::buildMessages()` line 140 (primary crash site) and `templateFileContextMessage()` RAG files payload; same inline guard added to `ProcessConversationTurn` line 60 which contains the identical pattern.
- **Non-fatal design** — Malformed guidelines are skipped; the turn still generates a response rather than failing the conversation.
- **11 regression tests** added in `PersonaGuidelinesNormalizationTest` covering array/null/JSON-string/multi-line-string payloads through both `ProcessConversationTurn` and `ConversationService::generateTurn`, plus RAG file-path normalization and the migration logic.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-03-15 (AI Orchestrator)

### 🎛️ AI Orchestrator
- New `/orchestrator` module for defining and running automated multi-step AI conversation pipelines.
- **Wizard** (`/orchestrator/wizard`) — Claude-powered conversational setup wizard. Asks clarifying questions, then emits a structured JSON draft inside `<orchestration>` tags. User reviews the draft and clicks "Save & Create" to materialize it.
- **Orchestration model** — Named pipelines with optional cron schedule, timezone, status tracking (`idle` | `running` | `paused` | `completed` | `failed`), and soft deletes.
- **Steps** — Ordered steps with per-step persona/provider/model overrides, three input sources (`static`, `previous_step_output`, `variable`), four output actions (`log`, `pass_to_next`, `store_as_variable`, `webhook`), condition gates, and `pause_before_run` flag.
- **Runs** — `OrchestratorRun` and `OrchestratorStepRun` records capture full execution history: status, timing, output summaries, error messages, and links to underlying conversations.
- **Variable bag** — Runtime `variables` JSON on each run; steps store/read named values using dot notation.
- **Condition evaluation** — `contains`, `not_contains`, `equals`, `regex` conditions against previous step output; unmatched steps are `skipped`.
- **`RunOrchestration` job** — Executes steps sequentially, dispatches the existing `RunChatSession` job synchronously per step, captures output, applies output actions, handles pause/resume flow.
- **`ResumeOrchestratorRun` job** — Picks up execution from the paused step when a user approves.
- **Artisan commands** — `orchestration:run {orchestration}` for manual triggers; `orchestration:schedule` for cron dispatch (registered in `routes/console.php`, runs every minute via `withoutOverlapping`).
- **Real-time events** — `OrchestratorRunCompleted`, `OrchestratorStepStarted`, `OrchestratorStepPaused` broadcast on the user's private channel.
- **Frontend** — `Orchestrator/Index`, `Wizard`, `Show`, `Runs/Index`, `Runs/Show` pages in the Midnight Glass design system.
- **Dashboard card** — Orchestrator module added to the dashboard with violet-purple gradient.
- **27 new tests** — Feature tests covering auth, CRUD, run dispatch, authorization, wizard validation; unit tests for all condition evaluation paths.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-03-15

### ⭐ Persona Favorites
- Added `is_favorite` boolean field to personas (default `true` for all new personas).
- New `PATCH /personas/{persona}/favorite` route (`personas.favorite`) to toggle favorite status.
- Personas list now sorts favorites to the top, then by most recently created.
- Star toggle rendered inline on the Personas index page.
- Added a clear-favorites action and favorites-only filter controls on the Personas index page.

### 🧭 MCP Utilities Docs & Endpoint Examples
- Updated `/admin/mcp-utilities` endpoint table to show API-key-ready `curl` examples (including Authorization headers and JSON payload where needed).
- Updated `README.md` and `MCP.md` to document Personal Access Token usage for `/api/mcp/*` and `/api/admin/mcp-utilities/*` routes.

### 🧠 Embedding Tracking & Retry
- New `embedding_status`, `embedding_attempts`, `embedding_last_error`, `embedding_skip_reason`, `embedding_last_attempt_at`, and `embedding_next_retry_at` columns on `messages` table for observability.
- `MessageEmbeddingPopulator` service handles embedding generation with exponential backoff (60s → 5m → 15m → 30m), max 5 attempts.
- `PopulateMessageEmbeddingJob` dispatched per message; skips already-embedded or `skipped`-status messages and respects `embedding_next_retry_at` cooldown.
- New `ai.embedding_population_max_attempts` and `ai.embedding_input_max_chars` config keys.

### 📄 Document RAG — DOCX & PDF Support
- Template file context now supports `.docx` and `.pdf` uploads in addition to `.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`, and `.json`.
- DOCX text extracted via `ZipArchive` from `word/document.xml`, paragraph/table tags converted to line breaks.
- PDF text extracted via regex-based PDF string literal parsing with escape decoding and octal replacement.
- All extracted content normalized: UTF-8 validation, whitespace collapsing, and length capping via `ai.embedding_input_max_chars`.
- File context injection decoupled from cross-chat memory — template docs are injected even when cross-chat RAG is disabled.

### 📋 Transcript Enhancements
- Transcripts now include a **Chat Header** section summarising: session label, starter prompt preview, memory window, cross-chat memory state, and attached RAG document names.
- Each message entry now includes **Provider** and **Model** fields for traceability.

### 🔧 MCP Tools Fix
- Tool request construction switched from `new Request([...])` to `Request::create('/', 'GET', [...])` — fixes query-string population for `searchConversations`, `getContextualMemory`, and `getRecentChats`.
- `conversation_id` parameter type corrected from `integer` to `string` in the `getConversation` tool schema.
- Added `GET /api/mcp/contextual_memory` alias (underscore) alongside the existing hyphenated route for broader client compatibility.

### 🛠️ Admin MCP Utilities API
- New API routes under `/api/admin/mcp-utilities` (require Sanctum token + admin role):
  - `GET /embeddings/compare` — compare DB vs Qdrant embedding counts.
  - `POST /embeddings/populate` — trigger batch embedding backfill.
  - `POST /flush` — flush MCP caches.
  - `GET /traffic` — retrieve recent MCP tool execution events.

### 🔄 Scheduler
- Replaced `pulse:snapshot` with `pulse:check` in the console schedule for Laravel Pulse compatibility.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-03-12

### 🔑 Personal Access Tokens
- New `/personal-tokens` page for users to create and manage Sanctum personal access tokens.
- Tokens can be used in place of the shared `CHAT_BRIDGE_TOKEN` env variable for API authentication.
- Token name input + copy-on-creation modal with one-time plaintext display.
- Full delete support with per-user ownership enforcement.

### 🔐 API Authentication Upgrade
- Chat Bridge API (`POST /api/chat-bridge/respond`) now accepts either the legacy shared env token or a user personal Sanctum token via `EnsureChatBridgeOrSanctumToken` middleware.
- MCP API routes (`/api/mcp/*` and `POST /api/mcp`) now require a personal Sanctum token (`EnsureSanctumToken`), scoping all tool calls to the authenticated user.

### 🧠 Embedding Provider Priority Swap
- `EmbeddingService` now uses **OpenRouter as the primary embedding provider** and falls back to OpenAI when no OpenRouter key is configured.
- Removes the previous OpenAI-primary / OpenRouter-fallback order that required a failed OpenAI call before trying OpenRouter.

### 🔧 System Diagnostics Additions
- **Embeddings Key panel** — Admin can update, test, and clear the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` used for embeddings directly from `/admin/system`.
- **Reload PHP-FPM** — New diagnostic action to gracefully reload PHP-FPM without downtime.

### 🎨 Dashboard Live Status Redesign
- Active-conversation indicator on the dashboard now shows an animated glow card with pulsing rings, waveform bars, and a per-session label/turn counter.
- Idle state simplified to a muted indicator.

### 🗄️ Database
- Migration to widen `model_prices` decimal columns for providers that return prices with more decimal places.

### 🖼️ Favicons
- Added `public/favicon-32.png` and `public/favicon-192.png` for browser tab and PWA icon use.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-10

### 🛡️ Stream Resilience
- Fixed "Unable to read from stream" crash when TCP connection drops mid-response during large AI outputs (notably via OpenRouter with verbose models like `openai/gpt-oss-120b`).
- `OpenAIDriver` and `OpenRouterDriver` now catch `RuntimeException` from the PSR-7 stream reader after content has already been yielded — logging a warning and breaking cleanly rather than crashing the job.
- Added `isStreamReadError()` helper recognising Guzzle/PSR-7 stream failure signatures: `unable to read from stream`, `stream is detached`, `connection reset`, `broken pipe`.

### 🔧 MCP Tool Filtering
- Model selector on the chat creation page now hides tool-call-incapable models when MCP is enabled.
- All provider model list endpoints return a `supports_tools` flag derived from live API metadata.
- Amber hint beneath the model count shows how many models were hidden due to missing tool support.

### 🌐 Live Provider Model Queries
- All AI providers now query their live APIs for available models using the configured key rather than returning static lists.
- OpenRouter: reads `supported_parameters` to set `supports_tools`.
- DeepSeek: queries `https://api.deepseek.com/v1/models` (OpenAI-compatible); infers tool support from model ID.
- Bedrock: queries `https://bedrock.{region}.amazonaws.com/foundation-models` with full SigV4 GET signing; filters to `ON_DEMAND` + `TEXT` output models.
- `ProviderController::getApiKey()` falls back to any active key for the provider if no user-scoped key exists.

### 🚧 Maintenance Banner
- Admin panel toggle to display a site-wide amber "Under Construction" banner during maintenance windows.
- State persisted to `storage/app/maintenance_banner.json` — survives cache clears and container restarts.
- Shared to every page as an Inertia prop via `HandleInertiaRequests`; rendered in `AuthenticatedLayout` with no extra client requests.

### ✏️ Edit & Retry for Failed Conversations
- New "Edit & Retry" button on failed conversation pages opens a modal to change provider/model for Agent A and/or Agent B before re-dispatching from the last completed round.
- `ChatController::retryWith()` validates and updates only the fields provided, records `retry_model_change` metadata, and resumes from remaining rounds.
- Route: `POST /chat/{conversation}/retry-with` (`chat.retry-with`).
- 4 new feature tests covering model update, both-agent update, non-failed rejection, and ownership enforcement.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-03-05

### 📊 Analytics Chart Data Integrity
- Hardened analytics chart input normalization on `Analytics/Index` to guarantee chart-safe numeric values.
- Fixed date label rendering for `YYYY-MM-DD` trend data to avoid timezone-shifted chart labels.
- Aligned `/analytics/metrics` payload shape with the dashboard by including `openRouterStats`.
- Added chart payload regression coverage in `AnalyticsTest` to enforce key/type expectations.

### 🧠 OpenRouter Stats Safety
- OpenRouter dashboard stats are now skipped in `testing` environment, avoiding external HTTP noise during test runs while preserving runtime behavior.

### 🖼️ Profile Avatar Save Reliability
- Updated profile avatar form submission to use multipart-safe method override (`POST` + `_method=patch`) so avatar uploads persist correctly.

### 🔴 Admin Redis Dashboard
- Added a dedicated admin Redis dashboard at `/admin/redis` with overview metrics (status, memory, cache efficiency, keyspace).
- Added live stats endpoint at `/admin/redis/stats` and a Boost Dashboard quick-link to the new Redis page.
- Added `AdminRedisDashboardTest` coverage for access control and stats payload structure.

### 🐳 Docker / Composer Compatibility
- Added PHP `gd` extension to Docker image builds to satisfy `phpoffice/phpspreadsheet` platform requirements used by `maatwebsite/excel`.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-03-04

### 🧠 Session Memory Controls
- Added per-session agent memory settings on chat creation:
  - `memory_history_limit` (recent turn context window)
  - `memory_rag_enabled` (cross-chat memory toggle)
  - `memory_rag_source_limit` (retrieved memory depth)
  - `memory_rag_score_threshold` (retrieval strictness)
- Chat creation now stores memory settings in conversation metadata and applies them at runtime.
- Turn generation now respects per-conversation history window (instead of a fixed value).

### 🛡️ Live Status Reliability
- Hardened `/chat/live-status` against cache backend outages:
  - stop-signal reads now fail open and return `stop_requested=false` instead of breaking the endpoint.
- Header live status widget now remains functional even when Redis/cache connectivity is temporarily unavailable.

### 🤖 Ollama Model + Tooling Support
- Expanded Ollama model discovery to query both common local endpoints:
  - Ollama native tags (`/api/tags`)
  - OpenAI-compatible model listing (`/v1/models` or `/models`)
- Added Ollama tool-calling support in the provider driver via `/api/chat` tool payloads.
- MCP traffic tooling now records provider/model context so Ollama tool activity is visible in admin monitoring.

### 🧭 MCP Utilities Traffic Watch
- Added MCP traffic monitor support class and event logging.
- Added admin MCP traffic endpoint: `/admin/mcp-utilities/traffic`.
- Added live traffic controls in the MCP Utilities page to inspect recent tool calls by provider (including Ollama).

### 🚨 Empty-Turn Failure Behavior
- Removed the static assistant fallback text (`"I need to regroup for a moment..."`) from runtime recovery.
- Empty/whitespace turn failures now exhaust retry/rescue attempts and then mark the conversation failed with structured context for debugging.
- Session UI now surfaces `last_error_context` metadata to make provider/model failure diagnosis explicit.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-02-27

### 🤖 **AI Chatbot (Ask the Archive)**
- Added **AI Chatbot** dashboard card linking to `/transcript-chat` with an API key status badge (green "Ready" / amber "API key required") based on the user's stored OpenAI key
- AI Chatbot now resolves the OpenAI API key from the user's saved API Keys first, falling back to the global `OPENAI_API_KEY` config — consistent with the rest of the app
- Added collapsible **Settings panel** on the Ask the Archive page:
  - **System Prompt** — override the default assistant instructions per session
  - **Model** — choose `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4o`, or `gpt-4o (nov)`
  - **Temperature** slider (0–1, default 0.3)
  - **Max Tokens** input (256–4096, default 1024)
  - **Sources** — number of transcript excerpts to retrieve (1–10, default 6)
  - **Min Score** slider — similarity threshold (0.05–1, default 0.3)
  - Settings button highlights when changed from defaults; "Reset to defaults" link restores them
- Lowered default similarity score threshold from **0.65 → 0.30** — typical conversational queries score 0.23–0.41 so the previous threshold silently returned no results
- Fixed `qdrant:init` chicken-and-egg bug: the command used `isAvailable()` (checks for collection existence) as a pre-flight check, causing it to fail before the collection was ever created; added `RagService::ping()` which hits `/collections` to verify Qdrant is reachable regardless of collection state
- Shortened the chat window height from `h-screen` to `calc(100vh - 9rem)` to fit cleanly within the visible viewport

### ⚡ **Parallel Queue Workers**
- Queue container now runs **4 parallel workers** via `supervisord` instead of a single `php artisan queue:work` process — up to 4 conversations can now stream simultaneously
- Added `docker/supervisor/queue-workers.conf` with `numprocs=4`, `--max-jobs=500`, and `stopwaitsecs=1200`
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` queue service command and added `./docker` volume mount so the supervisor config is live without a rebuild
- To increase concurrency, bump `numprocs` in `docker/supervisor/queue-workers.conf` and restart the queue container

## [Unreleased] - 2026-02-23

### 🛡️ Reliability & Error Handling

- Added automatic Discord thread creation support and persisted thread IDs for ongoing updates
- Added circuit-breaker behavior and safe failure handling so Discord outages do not break chat runs
- Added configurable Discord settings in `config/discord.php` and environment templates

### 🎭 **Persona Import / Export**
- **Import JSON on Create** - Upload a `.json` file on the create persona page to pre-fill all fields
- **Download Template** - Download a sample `persona-template.json` so users understand the expected format
- **Export JSON on Edit** - Export any persona from the edit page as a named JSON file (e.g. `technical-expert.json`)
- Exported files are directly re-importable on the create page

### 🐛 **Bug Fixes**
- Fixed Gemini API key checker crashing with a 500 error on brand-new keys — `strlen()` was being called on the `AIResponse` object instead of its `content` string
- Widened `catch (\Exception)` to `catch (\Throwable)` in the key test endpoint so PHP `Error` subclasses (e.g. `TypeError`) are handled gracefully
- Fixed OpenAI admin key checker crash by reading `AIResponse->content` before trimming

### 🧪 **Tests**
- Added `ApiKeyFactory` for use in tests
- Added three new `ApiKeyTest` cases: successful Gemini key validation, failed validation, and auth enforcement
